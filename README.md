Can the phenomenon known as [synesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia) be harnessed so that someone can receive and perceive sound in real time, without the use of auditory sensory organs.

# Problem

People be deaf.

# Proposal

Encode audio information to be transferred into the brain via some other human sense. The hope is that the information be perceived using the same neural pathways that would normally be used for perceiving sound.

## Potential Carrier Senses

### Color

Perhaps a single point of color could be used to convey a frequency domain sound signal. A potential problem, the input would have high dimentionality, while the output (color) would be limited to three or four dimensions (red, green, blue, and given the right hardware, total luminance).

Does the entire field of view need to be flooded with the color, or can the color show up in only a small portion of the users vision?

### Two Color Channels

One for each eye?

### Shapes

Been done before with extreme success, but does not cover all cases.
- Writing
  - isn't the same. I'm looking for something real-time. A way to emulate hearing, not just a way to communicate semantics. Text can efficiently convey only a subset of the data that human auditory systems can perceive. [^2]
- Spectrograms
  - Are difficult to decipher in real time [^1].

Both examples rely on the complex processes that are needed for humans to decipher shapes. I'm no neuroscientist, but I think real-time synesthesia will need to skip those complex processes.

### Touch

[Auditory tactile synesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia#Auditory%E2%80%93tactile_synesthesia) is rare, but does occur naturally.

[^2]: As an example, consider the challenge: use text to inject the qualia that would be triggered by a specific birdsong into the users mind. A very skilled writer may be able to accomplish the task with varying accuracy and varying success, but not in real time. Composing the text would take significantly longer than it takes to hear the sound. Consuming the text would also take significantly longer.
